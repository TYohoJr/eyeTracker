// To Do

// Bug: After changing option from a saved option and then running the exercise, the options reset to saved options, not the options they just used
// Make all exercises auto go back to options screen once finished
// Make random saccades dot unable to end up near the very middle of the screen
// Consider Re-doing some of the speed options
// Make saccades dot end on last frame (if that doesn't mess up cycles option)
// Add change password to account page
// Add other content tbd in account page
