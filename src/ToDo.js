// To Do

// Move static CSS properties to CSS files
// Make sure all classes/id's are unique to the exercise to avoid accidental CSS
// Try doing combinations using instances of a class to see if keyframes will start on mount
// Add more dot color options (green, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, black)
// Conditional options for pursuits in combinations exercise
// Redesign all buttons
// Re-do all speed options to make a smoother gap between options
// Separate the done button div and the rest of the exercise page
// Try to give pursuits a cycles option
// Make saccades last dot less jumpy
// Make cycles of random saccades a drop down list (also add infinite option)
// Change homepage images to percent sizes instead of static (unless that ends up breaking it on small screens...)
// Integrate a database so someone can save their exercise settings and load them on login (noSQL would probably make the most sense)
// Add navbar for login option
// Add footer to homepage
