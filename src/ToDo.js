// To Do

// Try doing combinations using instances of a class to see if keyframes will start on mount(ok this is harder that i thought it would be...)
// Redesign all buttons
// Re-do all speed options to make a smoother gap between options
// Integrate a database so someone can save their exercise settings and load them on login (noSQL would probably make the most sense)
// Add navbar for login option
