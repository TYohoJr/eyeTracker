# Eye Tracker
Eye Tracker is a personal project to bring exercises that neurologists typically use with patients that have an abnormal vestibular system, to a web based application. This is the front-end code. The back-end can be found at [Eye Tracker Server](https://github.com/TYohoJr/eyeTracker-server).

## Features
* Home page with multiple options of exercises to choose from
* Options page to better suite each exercise to the users needs
* Log in option to save settings for each exercise to improve user friendliness
